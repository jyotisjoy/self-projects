# Sales Forecasting

## Overview 
For any departmental store, it is important to have a rough idea of their sales, so that
they can plan their inventory accordingly. Determining the sale of high-selling and
low-selling products of each category is also key for inventory planning.

## Problem Statement
In this data science project, I will use R programming language to predict the sales of each
department of a store using the Walmart dataset.

## Data Description 
Walmart Dataset has sales data of 45
stores based on store, department and
week.
  * Size and type of each store has been
mentioned.
  * Holidays weeks have been provided.
  * Price markdown data (almost like discount
data) has been mentioned.
  * A few macro-indicators like CPI,
Unemployment rate, Fuel price etc. are
also provided

## What I learned 
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
techniques.
* Handling Missing values in a dataset.
* Using Univariate Analysis.
* Performing Bi-variate Analysis.
* Time Series ARIMA models
Implementation.
* Using multiple metrics to compare the
performance of different models.
